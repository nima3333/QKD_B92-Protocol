# QKD_B92-Protocol

As a part of the INFPHY201 course, we had a project to do : the simulation of the B92 key distribution protocol.

To open this project, either open the html file (simplest way) or the jupyter notebook (to freely run and modify the code).
If you do not have a jupyter environment, use a Google Colab instance.
