The particularity of QKD would be that **it has a higher level of security that would justify its deployment for high security applications**. However, the **inherent constraints** of this technology do not allow for its massive deployment that would offer high security guarantees in practice. Moreover, even taking into account the possible emergence of new threats to current cryptological means, foremost among which is the universal quantum computer, the future of secure communications can be assured over time **without the need to use QKD**. Thus, while this technology may eventually be called upon to play a role in niche applications, **it is not the natural evolutionary path for secure communications**.\"\n","\n","* \"this position paper does not concern quantum communications in general, nor networks for transporting quantum states. These topics are largely prospective, in contrast to QKD.\"\n","\n","* \" The point here is not to pronounce on the advisability of investing in research and innovation in the fields of QKD or quantum communications, which have porosity with other subjects such as quantum computing. Such investments are likely to be breakthroughs; they are essential to support European scientific and technical excellence and contribute to the development of its strategic autonomy.\"\n","\n","* \"The security guarantees provided in principle by the QKD are provided **at the cost of heavy employment constraints** which reduce the scope of the services offered and compromise the level of security that can be achieved in practice, particularly in scenarios where communications pass through a network of interconnected QKD links. While the use of QKD on point-to-point links can nevertheless be envisaged as a complementary measure to conventional cryptographic means in a defence-in-depth logic, the expenditure involved in such a choice should not be at the expense of the fight against current threats to information systems. \"\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bcaMS4QSge6Q","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Bibliography"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hqpnmOD_ghlY","colab_type":"text"},"source":["https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/cryptography-b92/B92_photons.html\n","\n","http://www.rri.res.in/quic/qkdactivities.php\n","\n","https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/publication/should-quantum-key-distribution-be-used-for-secure-communications/?fbclid=IwAR1sBFkKKVkq2-dL3O1Hn6PRzI6Y-GYM87bZ5rHeCuqT8P_4KumTsm2Aips"]}]}
